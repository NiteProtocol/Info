### TRVL Utility

TRVL is the native utility token that powers the Nite Protocol, enabling travel suppliers to process bookings without relying on centralized intermediaries. Similar to prepaid electricity or mobile credits, suppliers maintain a balance of TRVL to continue facilitating bookings, topping up as needed when their balance runs low.

TRVL is also used to pay protocol fees and enables staking mechanisms that reward participants for supporting the network. Anyone can stake TRVL on a property listing to earn a share of booking fees generated through the Nite Protocol.

#### Core Utilities

* **Booking Fees**: TRVL is required to process bookings and transfer Nite tokens from the Property Management Smart Contract (PMSC) to the guest.

* **Staking**: TRVL can be staked on individual property listings. Stakers earn a portion of Nite Protocol booking fees whenever a reservation is processed on that listing.

* **Governance**: TRVL will be used to vote on protocol parameters and guide the future direction of the Nite Protocol.
