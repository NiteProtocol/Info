# Parameters (Draft)

The Nite Protocol and the TRVL Tokenomics have a few parameters that can be updated and changed over time.

This document lists all these parameters and how they can be updated.


## Nite Protocol's Smart Contract Parameters

These parameters are encoded in smart-contracts.

| Parameter                   | Value                       |  Status                   |
| ---                         | ---                         |  ---                      |
| Nite Token Transfer Fee     | 100 TRVL per Nite Token     |  Implemented in v4        |
| Minimum Booking Fee         | 5%                          |  Being implemented for v5 |

In v4 and v5, these parameters can be updated by the TRVL Foundation.
The TRVL Foundation shall consult TRVL holders regarding updates of these parameters. 
For now, discussions about such updates should occur in [Discussions/Parameters-Updates](https://github.com/orgs/NiteProtocol/discussions/categories/parameter-updates).

If there is demand and resources, on-chain governance mechanisms to allow TRVL holders to update these parameters directly on-chain shall be implemented.


## TRVL Tokenomic Parameters

These parameters are not encoded in smart contracts. They relate to management of the TRVL funds under the comtrol of the TRVL Foundation.

| Parameter                                           | Value                                                           |
| ---                                                 | ---                                                             | 
| Community Treasury Unlocking Delay                  | 1 month                                                         | 
| Community Treasury Maximum Unlocking Rate           | 5% of the Community Treasury's current balance per year         |
| Growth Fund Release Schedule                        | 100 TRVL per qualified new property                             |
| Minimum booking value to qualify as a new property  | 2000 TRVL                                                       |

The TRVL Foundation shall consult TRVL holders regarding updates of these parameters. 
For now, discussions about such updates should occur in [Discussions/Parameters-Updates](https://github.com/orgs/NiteProtocol/discussions/categories/parameter-updates).

If there is demand and resources, off-chain or on-chain mechanisms to allow TRVL holders to choose values for these parameters more directly shall be pursued.
